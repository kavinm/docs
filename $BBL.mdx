You can think of \$BBL    as an additional type of mass that can be absorbed by
bubbles. When a bubble absorbs \$BBL    you will see its \$BBL    value go up.

Once \$BBL    is absorbed by a bubble it can be emitted as a powerful weapon. When it hits an opposing bubble, **it causes a puncture and forces it to leak smaller bubbles.**
**However, it also acts as a shield to prevent punctures from \$BBL    attacks**.
EP evens the playing field allowing smaller bubbles to launch attacks on bigger ones.
