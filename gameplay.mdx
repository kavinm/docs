<h2>How to play?</h2>
Navigate to the <a target="_blank" href="https://bubblewars.io">Bubblewars.io</a> website, sign in with twitter, farcaster or a web3 wallet of your choice.
Once logged in, you will be prompted to deposit ETH to our rollup from Ethereum mainnet or Blast L2.
When your account is funded you can start playing the game.

<h2>Spawning</h2>
You start the game by spawning your <a href="/portals">portal</a> on the map. 
The spawn point of your portal is calculated at random based on the state of the world (proximity to other players, resources, etc).
The spawning of your your <a href="/portals">portal</a> happens automatically when you first deposit funds to our rollup.
All the funds you deposit to the rollup in the future get stored within your <a href="/portals">portal</a>.
Additionally, these funds can be withdrawn back to ETH mainnet or Blast L2 at any time.
The <a href="/portals">portal</a> serves as your entry and exit point into the game world. 
From your <a href="/portals">portal</a> is where you will emit all of your <a href="/bubbles">bubbles</a>.

<h2>World Traversal</h2>
Click on your portal to toggle its controls. 
Begin emitting bubbles of specified masses (in ETH) in any direction you choose.
Remember that ETH is 1:1 with kilograms in this game world.
The smaller the mass you emit from your portal the faster the bubble will travel.
Once you have your bubbles within the game world you must navigate them in a more precise manner.
The world is a vacuum (for the most part). Meaning your bubbles will continue to travel in the direction they were emitted until they collide with another object in the game.
So you must propell your bubbles by emitting mass in the opposite direction of the desired travel.
As you move throughout the world, any object with smaller mass than your bubble will be absorbed by it.
Chase down opponents around the map and absorb their bubbles while avoiding larger opponents that could absorb you.
And keep track of the mass you emit to traverse the world.
In addition to absorbing bubbles (ETH) you can absorb tokens and NFTs that spawn into the world and function as <a href="/powerups">power-ups</a>.
