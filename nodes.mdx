<h3>Nodes emit \$BBL    when injected with bubbles.</h3>
The amount of \$BBL    emitted decays as more ETH is deposited into them.

Nodes emit Resources like **BLUE**, **RED** or **GREEN** along a bonding curve.
When ETH (bubbles) is injected into a Node it emits back the appropriate resource amount.
When resources are injected into a Node, it emits back the appropriate ETH (bubbles) out.
