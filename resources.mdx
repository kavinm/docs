<h3>
  In addition to absorption, bubbles have other ways of attacking each other via
  Resources called Energy Points (EP).

You can think of EP as an additional type of mass that can be absorbed by
bubbles. When a bubble absorbs EP you will see its EP value go up.

Once EP is absorbed by a bubble it can be emitted as a powerful weapon. When it hits an opposing bubble, **it causes a puncture and forces it to leak smaller bubbles.**
**However, it also acts as a shield to prevent punctures from EP attacks**.
EP evens the playing field allowing smaller bubbles to launch attacks on bigger ones.
