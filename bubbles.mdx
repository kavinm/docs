<h3>Bubbles are your main means of dominating the world.</h3>

When 2 bubbles make contact, **the bubble with the larger mass will absorb the bubble
with the smaller mass**. Your main goal is to absorb opposing bubbles and bring back
your bubbles to your home portal.

**However, in order to propel your bubbles around the map you must
emit smaller bubbles from them.** This follows the law of conservation of mass: If you want to
go left, you emit a smaller bubble to the right.
